“There is intelligent speculation as there is intelligent investing.” 
/— The Intelligent Investor (Chapter I), Graham/
*Gambling vs. Speculating*
1. There are two games in our universe: games where the odds are /known/andgames where they are /hidden/.
2. We can figure out your chances at Roulette. Say, if you picked Red, or the number 13. If you know the rules, all you need to do is simple math. Or… just google it. 
3. “Rolling the dice” is *not*whatmakes youa gambler. 
*4.* *Gambling*isbetting when these 3 things are true:
a.) the odds are /known/, *
b.) the odds /cannot/ be influenced in your favor,c.)and — most importantly — those odds are /not/ in your favor.
5. Playing on the opposite side of a gambler is called being a /business/. The casino, like you, is also playing a game of chance — they are betting on the same dice, the same deck of cards. Bound by the same laws of physics… it faces the same, black, curtain of the unknown as you, as that dice hurtles through the air.
6. All a casino needs is a small advantage (i.e. 51% vs. your 49%) to cross that thin, but deep, chasm in the middle of the table — from “gambler” here to “business” over there.
7. You do not want to be a degenerate gambler. But if you can be a casino — roll dice for a living!
*8.* *Speculation, on the other hand, is betting in a game where the odds are**hidden**.*
9. In our everyday life, /speculation/ is the game that the universe has forced us to play.
*The RIght Way*
1. Thus: All games of probability have correct solutions.
2. This is known as *  (or “expected outcome” — which is easier on my mind)* [expected value](https://www.thoughtco.com/expected-value-3126582) .
3.  *A:* Multiply the prize by the odds of winning it. *B:* Multiply the amount you would lose by the odds of losing. Subtract *B* from *A*. 
4. If it’s positive, you have a positive expected outcome. The size of the answer determines how good or bad your expected outcome is. You will know if you are the gambler(irrational) or the businessman(rational) as you face the odds.
5. Just because you made money on a bet doesn’t mean you made the correct bet. 
*6.* *You should create space between the decision and the outcome and evaluate them independently.*
7. Of all things, this is the hardest — the mind revolts at this idea.
8. Lotto has horrible expected outcome. The worst. If you do the math — the expected outcome is to lose everything/anything you bet. The lotto wouldn’t be a business otherwise!
9. But…it is hard to tell the lotto winner he made the wrong choice when he bought his winning ticket. Try it. Your mind cannot accept it.
10. It bears repeating: in a game of probability, you can lose with a correct decision. And win with an incorrect one. /But you should always bet the right way./ 
11. Be careful of how you evaluate your decisions. Be the casino.
*Luck*
*1.* *Luck, then, is just the deviation/variance from expected outcomes*. If you run across an interstate highway and make it to the other side alive — that is what I call luck. Not the expected outcome! 
2. If you worked hard and shot for the moon, but landed in the stars instead, that is also luck.
3. Luck happens in a chaotic world. Luck goes both ways — unfortunately. And fortunately. So you should not “believe in luck” — rather, you should respect it.
4. Time erodes luck. Time reveals the true expected outcome of the game.
5. The gambler will not survive the waves of time, whereas the casino wants more of it. You need to be lucky to win in the short-term, but in the long-term — you need to be right. 
6. What are the expected outcomes of your decisions — ignoring luck? Strive to be rational — then seize moments of fortune when they come. And protect your downside, always, so you can ride long into the future.
*The Strange Case of Lotto with Good Odds*
1.  Most low probability games in life are negative expected outcome. Bad bets. Again, Lotto. 
2. We have a bias against low odds for good reason. However, keep in mind that a game can both be *low probability* /and/ *positive expected outcome* at the same time. 
3. How? This can happen if the money at risk is small, the prize is high and if the odds to win are *just* high enough. It might sound like lotto on the surface, but it is worlds apart. The probability might be low, but somehow the expected outcome remained in your favor. The math worked.
4. Imagine a theoretical Lotto game where you win multi-millions with a chance to win of, say, a “measly” 5% instead of the usual .000001%. A lotto game with this setup would never exist in the real life for obvious reasons, but if it did, it would suddenly be quite rational to buy a ticket — even though “5% to win” —by usual measures, feels like a low probability. I’d certainly buy a few! *
5. I would consider good venture bets to be of this nature — odds that “sound” low (i.e. 1%, 5%, 10%… chance of working) but *positive expected outcome*(also see  [Black Swan Farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html) /Asymmetric bets) — due to outsize potential and the cost of risk. This is especially true of contentious ideas — the good ideas that look like bad ideas. The market may give it something 0% chance of working, but if understood correctly, its odds might be “low” but just high enough. You wouldn’t go all in, but in these rare cases, a small bet might be wise.
6. To summarize: not all bets with big win size are good bets. And not all bets with low odds are bad. Make sure to do the math!
/* Would need to factor in ticket cost and win size of course/
/** The other thing that makes a casino a “business “ is bet size/capitalization. It can have an edge on every single hand, but it would never go all in and is well capitalized. A topic for another day./
/***What is hidden vs. what is know can be philosophically argued. But I define Known odds as a scenario in which your assumptions are single variable. all we need to know the the odds are true are if the math you did is correct, and that the casnio is not cheating. Compare this with thinking about what the odds are of Company XYZ’s stock gaining — the variables are expontential/chaortic — one would have to assume things about economy, customers, interest rates other./
**** It is probably implied, but I view all forms of investing as a form of speculation based on my definition. But speculation does not connote something bad for me. So I disagree with Graham — I believe value investing is a form of intelligent/rationcally grounded, speculation, based on clear, consistent assumptions.

*The Game of**Hidden**Odds = A game of assumptions*
1. Games in which the odds are /hidden/can be tackled with the same strategies as games where the odds are /known/.****
*2.* *Intelligent speculation* then is merely making the correct decisions, based on /assumed/ odds.
3. A gambler is focused on /possibility/. Do the opposite. Bet on /probability/. Always bet on the side of /positive expected value/, even if it’s based on /assumed/ odds.
4. In a game of hidden odds, we must rely on intelligence to make assumptions and then reason up from them. Unfortunately, this is the best us mortals can do. We have entered the gray area of life. This is the /art/ of speculation. 
*5.* *Assumptions are everything in this game.*The calculation(logic) is easy. It’s the inputs that are hard.
6. Logic is a sneaky trap especially for the thinkers. You can be lulled by the beauty of your own reasoning, while getting caught off guard by an underlying assumption you thought was lock-in safe. Many times you will not be even conscious of these. 
7. Finding an incorrect assumption is like finding treasure — and the deeper and lower that assumption is, the bigger the reward.** 
8. Changes in starting assumptions — /perspectives —/are usually what start revolutions. Paradigm shifts. Challenging long-held assumptions held in strong consensus is tough — but, that’s the rush. Investing, in some way, is finding where you disagree with the world. (Peter Thiel asks this in his interviews) (GOOD IDEAS THAT LOOK LIKE BAD IDEAS DIAGRAM)
9. Sometimes there is not enough information to make a call. Realize that “not playing” or sitting out a bet is a valid but often times forgotten choice.
10. And… Just because you have done your meticulous analysis… you may think that you have now left the realm of speculation. Unfortunately: You are still speculating! You may have felt the odds, but you will *never* truly see them.
11. A metaphor: Imagine reaching into a bag of colored stones. You draw a stone. It’s red. Another. White. 
12. After drawing out a few, we might be able to make some “educated” guesses about the odds of this bag. You might reason — after drawing out a lot of reds — that the bag probably contains mostly reds. 
13. After drawing out a hunderd, a thousand, of these stones…you may even get very confident and bold in your analysis. But the truth is we will /never/ /know for sure what the true distribution of the colors were inside the bag/until the final stone is drawn.  [The final stone tells all](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Problem_of_induction) . 
14. Now consider: time hides an eternity of “stones” in the dark…
15. It is critical that you account for this immovable curtain. In a card game where expected value is on your side, you can simply protect yourself from (/bad) luck/by being well capitalized .
16. But in a game of /hidden/ odds, you /must/ increase this moat and also protect yourself from being absolutely wrong about those odds in the first place.

*Predictions vs. Forecasts*
1. The people on TV earn their money from making confident calls. Tarot card readers, too. People want certainty, and confidence sells. It’s entertaining, but also it might give you a (false) confidence in the future.
2. Forecasts, on the other hand, are almost *never* 100% confident.* They speak in probabilities, and they shift over time. Forecasts are what weather scientists do. Be a weather forecaster.
3. Time is like a fog: you can see the rough shapes ahead but the objects get clearer as you approach. Steer your ship accordingly. It is your most powerful weapon. **
4. It is not about how often you change your mind — but rather, w/hy/. 
5. If you are open and actively looking for information to change your mind and look at the /right/ things, paradoxically, you will likely find that you change your mind /less/.
6. The price dropped 3 seconds ago. Should you sell? Now it is up. Should you buy? Did the above say something meaningful about the future? This is not to say that price cannot affect reality (see  [Reflexivity](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Reflexivity_%28social_theory%29) ). But be clear about the causal chain behind your prediction.
7. Couch and hedge your predictions with caveats. Be “wishy washy”.
8. Always say: “I predict X…/but only if../.” This does two things. First, it reveals the equation you are using for your speculation. And second, it forces you to reveal your assumptions.
9. If you are aware of both your assumptions and your equations, then you can evaluate and improve them. Predicting without this is like writing down an answer to a math problem without showing the work. You learn nothing from a random answer, even if it happens to be correct. Show the work and let the world teach you.
10. “Exactly one year ago, I predicted X…”, “This guy predicted that AMZN would go 300%, here’s what he’s saying about XYZ!” are qualifiers that hold little weight.
11. Do not attach your predictions to your ego. 
** Howard Marks. You will see this. It might be infuriating to read.
*** There is also the case for non-predictive approach to life, which I also agree with. See Anti-fragile.

“We might have trouble forecasting the temperature of the coffee one minute in advance, but we should have little difficulty in forecasting it an hour ahead.”

*Broad Strokes and Truisms*
1. It is sometimes easier to predict something bigger and farther out in the future than something small in the next moment. It is easier to know the approach of the tide than the movement of one ripple or a droplet in the ocean.
2. The world contains a lot of noise. There are many things that change in this world, but it is more important to know  [what probably won’t](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/966699-i-very-frequently-get-the-question-what-s-going-to-change)  and then reason from that. 
3. An imperfect analogy: You can try and predict the hourly weather. Or you can make statements far into the future (January is going to be colder than June 10 years from now) — closer to inveitable. The former is useful, but very unstable akin to day trading. The later has high probability/invetiable — but something that is probably too obvious and priced in. The trick is to find what you believe is invetable — but is still contentious. To expand on an earlier statement: Investing is about finding what is true but that is underestimated due to human bias (ex: if we are still in the realm of weather, the closest would Climate change — too far in the future for people to understand exponential, and still “contentious” or under appreciated especially as far as making investment decisions.)
4. An example of a /tide/ is the idea of “Bits vs. Atoms”, posited in 1995 by Nicholas Negroponte in his seminal and prescient book “Being Digital” and summarized brilliantly  [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20170503042728/http://www.dangreller.com/bits-vs-atoms-the-driver-of-many-it-trends/) . One can identify undercurrents like this that are based on fundamental shifts in reality. Note: like all things, this too can change, reverse, or die. But the tide moves slower, and the turns are easier to catch. 
5. Be careful of time tested “knowledge”. Many are still speculations in disguise and should be treated with the same caveats.
6. For example, there is no law in physics that says the S&P500 /will/ return 7% in the future. 
7. This is not to say that this is an unreasonable assumption to make. But be sure you know /how/ we got to that piece of knowledge. And always be prepared when the assumptions or equations beneath it change.
8. There are two kinds of knowledge. Saying that apples will continue to fall from trees in the future (because we’ve seen it over and over for centuries …) is different from saying they fall because of a principle called gravity. It is a different kind of “knowing”. Both are useful, but one has more power and breadth than the other.
9. Always seek to learn the second kind. And always question /how/ you “know”.**
/** Knowing: Induction vs deduction is a foundational importance to understand. one is knowing by definition/logic, the other is knowing because we’ve seen. one is detached from time, the other is dependent on it. One reveals whether your calculation is correct. The other gives eveidence for assumptions. There is a paradox, between the two, but understanding the difference in my opinion is getting a glimpse of the boundary of knowledge. O/

*The History of the Future*
1. When speculating about the future, you should to not just look at history: what happened at each point in time. 
2. You should also look at the “history of the future”: what people /thought/ would happen.
3. Our predictions form a parallel timeline to actual events. The “future”, as we imagine it and how it emerges in media and culture, changes and has an evolution and a trajectory just like real events.
4. It is a good exercise to look at how people in the past viewed our recent past (their future). Books about the impending Y2K crisis. Scifi written in the 70s about the year 2010. Old articles. How people first reacted to the internet on TV.
5. Examples like  [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lskpNmUl8yQ) ,  [this](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/29/science/to-test-a-powerful-computer-play-an-ancient-game.html) ,  [this](https://www.amazon.com/Road-Ahead-Completely-Up-Date/dp/0140260404/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1509309484&sr=8-3&keywords=the+road+ahead) ,  [this](http://www.newsweek.com/clifford-stoll-why-web-wont-be-nirvana-185306)  and my favorite  [this](http://reprints.longform.org/playboy-interview-steve-jobs) . Unlike forecasts made today, we can evaluate these ways of thinking with full clarity thanks to the power of hindsight.
6. It is tempting (and a bit fun) to laugh at older, bad predictions. Instead, recognize that we are in the same boat. Someday our movies and books and reactions will be viewed in the same way. View them with humility: dissect the equations they used to make them and see which parts of thinking were wrong and right. Try and see which key assumptions they got wrong. Is there a pattern?
7. You will begin to see differences in how people extrapolate into the future. Note what most people see vs. what others do. What did people like Jobs or Bezos /ignore/ about their current reality to make leaps of imagination. And most importantly, what pieces of information did they focus on? Try and see with their eyes as they stood on the edge. It’s ‘85 and nobody is using a mouse. It’s ‘95 and using credit cards over the internet is a bit sketchy. It’s 2017. And we are looking with 2017 eyes.

*Jobs:* The most compelling reason for most people to buy a computer for the home will be to link it into a nationwide communications network. We’re just in the beginning stages of what will be a truly remarkable breakthrough for most people — as remarkable as the telephone.
*Playboy:* Specifically, what kind of breakthrough are you talking about?
*Jobs:* I can only begin to speculate. We see that a lot in our industry: You don’t know exactly what’s going to result, but you know it’s something very big and very good.

*All-in is actually sometimes not*
In a poker game, when you go “all-in”, you never actually are. “All-in”, in the truest sense, would mean selling the house and kids! 
It’s possible to make a bold, controlled bets and yet live to see another day. Companies need to make risky but smartly contained bets in order to survive (see Google X, Bell Labs, R&D…).
The games we play are sub games of sub games of sub games… There is always one game larger. Always one bigger why.
“When starting SpaceX I thought the odds of success were less than 10%, and I just accepted that I would probably just lose everything. But that maybe we would make some progress. If we could just move the ball forward, even if we died some other company could pick up the baton and keep moving it forward. So that would still do some good.”
It was perhaps a bit of luck that our ancestors in their rickety boats, pointed across the seas this way rather than that, and said — let’s go. Risking /everything/ on low odds may sound crazy, but in the grand scheme of things may very well be sensible — /if/ what you are chasing is priceless.
